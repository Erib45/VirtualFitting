# Virtual Fitting Room
This is a Virtual Fitting Room prototype application developed for a thesis. 
The thesis explores a way to virtually try on clothes in order to lower return rates for online shopping.

# How to install
Because of GitHubs limitations when it comes to file size, Large File Storage (LFS) has to be used to upload the prototype application. This means that if you download the files normally using the "Download ZIP" button in a browser, some files are not downloaded properly. To fix this you will have to manually download specific files and replace the fautly ones with the manually downloaded ones. Here's a step by step guide:

* Download the repo zip file, and unzip it.
* Manually download the 3 following files from the folder "Virtual Fitting Room_Data":
  * globalgamemanagers.assets
  * resources.assets
  * sharedassets0.assets
* In the downloaded repo copy, in the folder "Virtual Fitting Room_Data", replace the 3 already existing .assets files with the manually downloaded ones.
* Navigate back to the top of the downloaded repo folder.
* Start the prototype application by running the "Virtual Fitting Room.exe" file.

# How to use
The prototype application should be fairly straight forward, but here's an explanation of some features.
On the left side of the screen there's a panel. On the panel you will find different input elements such as sliders and buttons. You can interact with these input elemets by by pressing or dragging on them using your mouse and the left mouse button.

The rest of the screen displays your human model. You can rotate your view around the human model by holding down the left mouse button and dragging your mouse. This only works when your mouse in not on the panel.
