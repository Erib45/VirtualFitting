# Virtual Fitting Room
This is a Virtual Fitting Room prototype application developed for a thesis. 
The thesis explores a way to virtually try on clothes in order to lower return rates for online shopping.

# How to install
* Download the repo files. 
* Run the "Virtual Fitting Room.exe" file.

# How to use
The prototype application should be fairly straight forward, but here's an explanation of some features.
On the left side of the screen there's a panel. On the panel you will find different input elements such as sliders and buttons. You can interact with these input elemets by by pressing or dragging on them using your mouse and the left mouse button.

The rest of the screen displays your human model. You can rotate your view around the human model by holding down the left mouse button and dragging your mouse. This only works when your mouse in not on the panel.
